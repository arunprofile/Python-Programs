self: self is the instance of a class, we can change the name of self if we want (self is preferred ).

# A sample class with init method
class Person:

    # init method or constructor
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age

    # Sample Method
    def say_hi(self):
        print("Hello, my name is", self.name, "and age", self.age)

        # The self parameter allows access to the object's attributes and other methods within the class.

    def welcome(self):
        print("Welcome this world !!..",self.name)
